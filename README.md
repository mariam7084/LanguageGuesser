# LanguageGuesser
A basic language guesser script that uses [franc](https://github.com/wooorm/franc) for natural language detection and [langs](https://github.com/adlawson/nodejs-langs) for getting the language name corresponding to ISO code.
> PS: reminder for my future self---> make a nice UI for this,whenever you have time, so that you don't run it from terminal :)
